The Li/composite polymer electrolyte (CPE)/pyrite battery, which has a high theoretical energy density (about 810 Wh kg − 1 based on 2.8e/FeS 2), and is made of cheap, non-toxic and green compounds is a good candidate for EV applications. Materials cost is estimated at 50$ kWh − 1 five times lower than that of other lithium and lithium-ion batteries. Over 500 100% DOD cycles (at c 3 rate) with a capacity fading rate of less than 0.1% per cycle were carried out in a small (1 cm 2 area) laboratory prototype cells with 7 mm-thick cathodes. Charge-discharge processes in the Li/LiI (PEO) n Al 2 O 3-based CPE/pyrite battery during long-term cycle life have been analyzed with the use of dq/dV curves. These studies furnish insights into the electrochemical behavior of pyrite in polymer electrolyte-systems. Up to seven phases have been identified and found to change during the first 50-100 cycles. These phases do not change much over the subsequent 400 cycles. The major phases have been recently identified by EXAFS and NEXAFS measurements. It was proved that reduction of the ferrous disulfide proceeds as a multi-stage process, first to Li 2 FeS 2 and finally to metallic iron. No evidence of FeS was found. When the battery is charged to 2.25 V, Li 2 − x FeS 2 is formed."}

However, side reactions between the soluble catalysts and lithium metal anode and more importantly, the deposition of the solid Li2O2 particle on which side (lithium anode or oxygen cathode) is inevitable for the solution phase discharge process in Li–O2 batteries, leading to the obvious capacity decay. Here we design and create a partial soluble metal nitroxides frameworks (MNOFs) to promote the “marriage” between the soluble and solid catalysts to overcome the most stubborn of these challenges. Taking advantage of the partial soluble property in the electrolyte, the prepared MNOFs can be simultaneously applied as the soluble and solid catalysts. MNOFs dissolving balance between electrolyte and cathode could construct a bridge between the electrolyte and cathode, which can not only suppress the corrosion reactions on Li anode, but also target discharge products deposition on the cathode. A 1Ah Li–O2 cell with a high areal specific capacity of 40 mA h cm-2 was demonstrated under a relatively low overpotential (~ 0.6 V). By ideally bridging the soluble and solid catalyst, the reversibility is significantly improved."}

Here we report room-temperature K−S batteries utilizing a microporous carbon-confined small-molecule sulfur composite cathode. The synergetic effects of the strong confinement of microporous carbon matrix and the small-molecule sulfur structure can effectually eliminate the formation of soluble polysulfides and ensure a reversible capacity of 1198.3 mA h g−1 and retain 72.5% after 150 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼97%. The potassium-storage mechanism was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations. The results suggest that K2S is the final potassiation product along with the reaction of 2K + S ↔ K2S, giving a theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g−1. Our findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance room-temperature K−S batteries but also offer a basic comprehension of the potassium storage mechanism of sulfur cathode materials."}

However, they suffer from poor cycling stability because of the formation of cracks in their particles during operation. Here, we present improved structural stability, electrochemical performance, and thermal durability of LiNi_{0.85}Co_{0.1}Mn_{0.05}O_2(NCM85). The Nb-doped cathode material, Li(Ni_{0.85}Co_{0.1}Mn_{0.05})_{0.997}Nb_{0.003}O_2, has enhanced cycling stability at different temperatures, outstanding capacity retention, improved performance at high discharge rates, and a better thermal stability compared to the undoped cathode material. The high electrochemical performance of the doped material is directly related to the structural stability of the cathode particles. We further propose that Nb-doping in NCM85 improves material stability because of partial reduction of the amount of Jahn−Teller active Ni3+ ions and formation of strong bonds between the dopant and the oxygen ions, based on density functional theory calculations. Structural studies of the cycled cathodes reveal that doping with niobium suppresses the formation of cracks during cycling, which are abundant in the undoped cycled material particles. The Nb-doped NCM85 cathode material also displayed superior thermal characteristics. The coherence between the improved electrochemical, structural, and thermal properties of the doped material is discussed and emphasized."}
