An LLM is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text in a self-supervised fashion. Pre-training helps LLMs learn general-purpose knowledge, such as statistical relationships between words. An LLM can then be fine-tuned with domain-specific data to perform downstream tasks (such as sentiment analysis).\n\nLLMs are extremely large in size (parameters in the order of millions). Full fine-tuning (which updates all the parameters in the model) is not required for most applications because typical fine-tuning datasets are relatively much smaller than the pre-training datasets.\n\n[Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685){:.external} is a fine-tuning technique which greatly reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks by freezing the weights of the model and inserting a smaller number of new weights into the model. This makes training with LoRA much faster and more memory-efficient, and produces smaller model weights (a few hundred MBs), all while maintaining the quality of the model outputs.\n\nThis tutorial walks you through using KerasNLP to perform LoRA fine-tuning on a Gemma 2B model using the [Databricks Dolly 15k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k){:.external}.
